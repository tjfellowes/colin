attention is required.

Inhalation

Move to fresh air. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Do not use mouth-to-mouth method if
victim ingested or inhaled the substance; give artificial respiration with the aid of a pocket
mask equipped with a one-way valve or other proper respiratory medical device. Immediate
medical attention is required.

Ingestion

Do not induce vomiting. Call a physician or Poison Control Center immediately.

Most important symptoms and
effects

Notes to Physician

Breathing difficulties. Causes burns by all exposure routes. .  Symptoms of overexposure
may be headache, dizziness, tiredness, nausea and vomiting: Product is a corrosive
material.  Use of gastric lavage or emesis is contraindicated.  Possible perforation of
stomach or esophagus should be investigated: Ingestion causes severe swelling, severe
damage to the delicate tissue and danger of perforation: May cause central nervous system
depression
Treat symptomatically

Suitable Extinguishing Media

Use water spray, alcohol-resistant foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide. Cool closed
containers exposed to fire with water spray.
