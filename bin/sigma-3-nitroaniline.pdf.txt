Body Protection 
Complete suit protecting against chemicals, The type of protective equipment must 
be selected according to the concentration and amount of the dangerous substance 
at the specific workplace. 

Respiratory protection 
Where risk assessment shows air-purifying respirators are appropriate use a full-
face particle respirator type N99 (US) or type P2 (EN 143) respirator cartridges as a 
backup to engineering controls. If the respirator is the sole means of protection, use 
a full-face supplied air respirator. Use respirators and components tested and 
approved under appropriate government standards such as NIOSH (US) or CEN 
(EU). 

Control of environmental exposure 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Do not let product enter drains. 
Discharge into the environment must be avoided.
