In case of skin contact 
In case of skin contact: Take off immediately all contaminated clothing. Rinse skin with 
water/ shower. Call a physician immediately. 

In case of eye contact 
After eye contact: rinse out with plenty of water. Immediately call in ophthalmologist. 
Remove contact lenses. 

If swallowed 
If swallowed: give water to drink (two glasses at most). Seek medical advice immediately. 
In exceptional cases only, if medical care is not available within one hour, induce vomiting 
(only in persons who are wide awake and fully conscious), administer activated charcoal 
(20 - 40 g in a 10% slurry) and consult a doctor as quickly as possible.
